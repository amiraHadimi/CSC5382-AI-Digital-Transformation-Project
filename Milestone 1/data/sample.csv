Forum: Per-discussion subscription	I am finding that my inbox is absolutely flooded with unwanted moodle mails off the forum script. This is very annoying and I know it will similarly annoy my users. In fact it will put them off the system.    The problem arises because unlike other discussion boards moodle messages are emailed to me from the entire forum, not just the thread I have started or responded to. The overwhelming of people's inboxes is a serious business: it could be said that moodle is generating spam because the email feature is so unfocused.    Is there any chance this is going to be improved please?	100
allow teachers to specify certain fields in database activity as required	When creating a database, allow the teacher to specify whether a field must be filled in or not.	20
Forum: Reply by e-mail	How about the ability to post to the forums via email?	100
Forum: proceed to next thread link	Please put a link to jump to the next thread in the forum interface... Forums are very cool but the evaluation process is time consuming and, for a teacher, time is everything when evaluating 100s of students...  	20
A use profile's course list is arbitarily limited with no way of seeing complete list	When viewing a user's profile, if the list of their courses exceeds 21 (I think) an ellipsis is displayed. This seems a bit useless because... a) You can't click on the ellipsis to see the rest of the courses b) The list isn't even in alphabetic order so it becomes even more arbitrary c) the ellipsis is easy to miss, so you may not realise the list is truncated  Suggest either making this work properly, i.e., the ellipsis is clickable OR if the list is not considered important just put "too many courses to show" if it exceeds a certain amount. It would seem sensible to display them in alphabetic order too.  Without this it is difficult for an administrator to see all the courses a user is in if (for example) checking role assignments.	13
Include bulk course create and remove with Moodle through the use of CSV files	We're looking to Moodle for a replacement to Blackboard Enterprise.  In order for Moodle to be a viable replacement we need a way to bulk create and delete courses based on CSV files.  The bulk create courses is handled by use of a 3rd party module (uploadcourse.php created by Rory Allford).  However once we import say 700+ courses there's no way to them bulk remove them at the end of a semester (removing 1 by 1 would be too time consuming).  We would really prefer that this functionality be included within Moodle, as relying on 3rd party modules (no matter how good they are), inherits a risk if the module stops getting updated.	100
Add "test database setup" to the "External Database" enrollment and authentication plugins	It is hard to test whether the administrative panel for External Database Authentication and for External Database Enrollment is configured correctly. Currently, you have to create fake user accounts or similar, and try to authenticate them or enroll them and see if they receive email, etc. (At least, that's how I tested it! Does someone have a better way?)    It woule be nice to have a "Test Connection" button on that page which goes through and makes sure all the db info (username, password, connection, etc.) and data mapping is correct. AND prints out all this stuff to the screen in an easy-to-read report.    Thank you!	4
Allow single-item scales	The single-item scale, "Useful", used on moodle.org is in demand! See http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=105515    Currently only scales of 2 or more items may be created.	8
backup or import of single quiz includes all questions in database	When making a backup of individual quizzes, no matter how many (or how few) quizzes I back up, the backup includes all questions from the question bank, not only those used in the quiz which I'm backing up. So, in an extreme case, if I back up a single quiz, and then restore it to another course, I unintentionally transfer hundreds of questions along with this quiz.    The same happens when importing a quiz to another course.	100
Adding data mapping for custom user fields	I'd like having the possibility to add data mapping for custom user fields when I use LDAP or DB auth modules	40
Implement import/export "Permissions" settings for "Manage roles" tab	Suggest to implement "import / export" settings for the role "permissions". See the two proposed solutions (probably only one need to be implemented)... This is particularly useful for larger "enterprise-level" moodle implementation as we often have staging, testing, and development moodle installations and if we have customized role settings, it is a pain in the butt to manually change all of them one by one (it's a long list of the "Permissions" for all the newly deployed moodle instances. Thanks!	20
Automatically and periodically save WYSIWYG editor content as a draft/concept	This emerged during the discussion at MDL-13370. Shortly: use AJAX to automatically and periodically (eg. every minute) save the content of a WYSIWYG editor to the concepts (drafts) space. See GMail for the working example.    It seems to me that we could use table mdl_post for this therefore not DB changes should be required. There will be a flag for a rich text field definitions that enables this feature. Every WYSIWYG will have to have some uniq identifier. Concepts are accessible to their owners only (and admins?) - maybe via a card in their profiles? Their lifetime is a subject of configuration - couple of hours by default.	40
Add grade item and student grades quick edit feature to the grader report	Add grade item and student grades quick edit feature to the grader report to enable editing for each grade item and for each student:    * Grades and feedback  * Grade overrides  * Excluded grades    Thanks to developers at the LSU for this feature - see http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=101449 for more details.  	100
Displaying and selecting dates throughout Moodle should allow the use of multiple calendars	I implemented a patch to add the capability of working with other calendar systems than just Gregorian.  I'll provide the instructions to apply the patch in following post	100
Non-graded Assignment and Quizzes appear in the gradebook  and have Max Grade assigned	Non-graded Assignment and Quizzes are getting displayed in the gradebook, and they look like being included into aggregation in the Cat&Items interface, since they have Max Grade value set to 100.  Other activities behave definitely. E.g. If Forum is not graded, it does not appear in the gradebook as a column. Which for me is an expected behavior.    1. Add an Assignment. Set it to No Grade. Column will still appear in the gradebook. Now go to the Cat&Items interface. It will display Max Grade for that column to be 100 points. (Though it will not be actually included into the calculation)  2. Add an Assignment. Set it to be graded on a scale (scales are NOT included in aggregation for us). Maximum Grade in the Cat&Items interface will display some number (e.g. 3, if there are 3 items in a scale). It is confusing, since one would now expect that 3 to be calculated toward course/category total.  3. Add a quiz, add some questions, and make the quiz to be worth 0 points. Maximum Grade in the Cat&Items interface will still be 10 points (or 100). Interestingly enough, I can manually delete a gradebook column for this kind of quiz. (But, once I delete a column, there is no way for me add it back, even though I will make the quiz gradable)    I think MDL-14017 is related to this. 	13
User profile: add last ip field to user view	Similar to MDL-18518, this request to add the Last IP address could be useful to a site administrator trying to track down where a user last access Moodle from. Patch for 1.9 attach, I'll come up for one for HEAD as well. Peace - Anthony	2
Add admin settings for disabling particular gradebook calculations, category overriding and grade minimum on the grader report	An admin setting for selecting which aggregation types are available was added to Moodle 1.9.5.    Further admin settings for disabling gradebook features such as multiplicator, offset, calculations (see MDL-18049 for details of exactly which features) should be added to Moodle 2.0.	40
Add unofficial support for custom context levels	This issue is in reference to http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=111362. In brief, one of our Moodle extensions would benefit greatly from being able to use Moodle's roles and contexts system, and we would need to define our own context levels.  However, we would like to be able to do this without having to differ from core in unmaintainable ways. We believe that this would be helpful to many other Moodle partners and plugin developers, and some of our proposed changes may help to improve the maintainability and readability of core Moodle code.	40
Course Participation Report doesn't abide by separate groups	In  1.97 (haven't tested other versions), the participation report shows all students to a non-editing teacher in a group.   My courses are set to separate groups, and permissions for Non-editing Teacher for showallgroups are set to prevent. When I log in as a non-editing teacher I set up, and go to the Course reports, click the participation report, choose an activity, and then set "Show only" to Student, all student show up.   Shouldn't the participation report also respect separate groups?	20
Chat window uses browser language rather than preferred language set in profile	Steps to reproduce:  1. Set browser language to say Dutch. 2. Login to demo.moodle.net with any of the demo accounts. 3. Access http://demo.moodle.net/mod/chat/view.php?id=203 and click the enter the chat.  Expected result: text in the chat window is in English (preferred language set in profile)  Actual result: text in chat window is in Dutch	3
Category children default to extra credit when category agg is switched from Weighted to Simple	Category 1 is set to Weighted Mean of Grades  Its children all have weights assigned to them  Category 1's agg method is switched to Simple weighted mean of grades  Its chlldren are now all extra credit    This was kinda, supposedly fixed with MDL-19407 but only took into account an item moved from a category of WM to SWM... not if the entire category is switched (common in our parts).	40
Design way to send files by web service (upload)	Find a way to send any files to any draft file area in Moodle and use them in the web service calls.      Original issue description:  {quote}  Sending files to hub currently works but the design has been refused by Petr because it uses ws token in a POST request with $_FILES. After talking with Dongsheng and Petr, the conclusion was we will be sending files by web service (probably called in a cron script, if the file is too big). And biggest files will be chunked in order to be sent. It implies to write a new file web service design.  Downloading files could need to follow the same design...  {quote}  	40
Moodle bug with course restore section count	Course import/restore: if source course has more sections, create them and increase numsections          Before this, all modules that were in non-existant sections sent to section 0. 	8
Allow admin to remain logged in after login as procedure	log in as admin to moodle 2 go to a course (home page is enough) from participants block, select a student and login as him/her do something (at least nothing) and return to your personal account at the end of this process, you are always logged out	20
TinyMCE can't be resized and doesn't scroll for wide content, especially on small screens	When editing an HTML page in 2.0 on a Netbook (I think the one I saw was an eeePC) the screen is so small that the dragging handle of TinyMCE gets cut off and the whole thing is pretty well useless - see http://screencast.com/t/NmE1ODEwM for an example. No idea if this is something which is fixable by setting the default width of the editor based on the width of the browser, but thought I'd mention it anyway...    *Replication steps:*  # Log in as admin  # Navigate to Site admin > Appearance > Site selector  # Choose a theme with blocks on the right, such as Binarus  # Navigate to a course  # Create a page resource  # Reduce the size of the browser window and note the effect on the HTML editor    Expected result: The HTML editor resizes down before it is covered by blocks on the right.    Actual result: The right edge of the HTML editor disappears under the blocks.	20
Properly deprecate unzip_file/zip_file	Sam - Related to your recent commit for MDL-19786, I did a grep of 2.0 code base and found a couple more instances of where the deprecated unzip_file/zip_file is being used:    /question/format/blackboard_six/format.php  /lib/componentlib.php    Peace - Anthony     p.s. - Perhaps we should create a meta issue to grep for deprecated functions as part of code clean up	3
Convert group members selector to Shifted YUI3 module.	After working on MDL-24262 I think it is a very good idea to convert the group/user selectors to object orientated yui modules with all arguments being passed in rather than set as globals within the page. This will make the code clearer, and help improve JS sandboxing.  Cheers Sam	13
Chat: autoscroll help popup incorrect and doesn't display fully (it only concerns the alternative chat methods)	Autoscroll help popup gives info on using chat, rather than the autoscroll feature.	3
a pagedown key press in any tinymce editor destroys entire page layout	a page down in any tinymce editor will kill the layout of (maybe almost) any page in moodle.  	20
Deleted Forum & Blog Posts in RSS Block	In Moodle 2.0.1+, even after deleting forum/blog post, it continues to show up in the RSS block even after cron is run. Spammers can exploit this.	8
Improve Grader report user interface	This issue is a large one focussed on improving usability and accessibility for teachers using Moodle gradebook (Grader report) on all browsers including touch screens and screen readers.    The Moodle Gradebook Working Group met in June 2014 and determined a number of key required features, which are detailed on the specification at http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Grader_report_2014  (still being finished).    In a nutshell expect:  # Full screen spreadsheet-like display that scrolls well but has static headers and footers.  # Filters to quickly reduce the information being dealt with.  # Links to row/column editors for speed and affordances.	100
'Choose a link' for database URL field gives confusing message	Going to add/edit a record in the "Modules and plugins" database a user founds a lot of "Choose link" button. The problem is that these buttons are completely useless because the file picker page they call, displays: "Spiacente, nessuno dei repostory disponibili può restituire file esterni." [that in English should sound like: Sorry, none of the available repository may return external files.]  Please take these buttons off.	8
Embedded MP4 videos via linking to the course file loops when finished playing.	When I embed a QuickTime video (MP4) like this:   {code}  <a href="http://mymoodlesite.org/file.php/#/videos/Video_Title.mp4?d=800x450"></a>   {code}  It loops automatically when it is finished playing. This doesn't   happen with FLV videos.     I went into the Moodle folder   -->filter   ------>multimediaplugin   ----------->Find every occurrence of the word loop (there were 4) and   change true to false.   Then I went back to where the video was embedded and added this tag   before my embedded link:   {code}  <param name="loop" value="false" />   {code}  The video stopped after playing once. 	5

Default timezone is incorrect when not set in PHP configuration	When 'date.timezone' is not set in the PHP server configuration, Moodle sets the base timezone to PHP's default which is 'Asia/Jayapura'. When you then set a timezone in the administration area, to say 'Australia/Adelaide', the time is half an hour too fast. If the 'date.timezone' is set in the PHP server configuration, this is not an issue.    The problem seems to be that PHP is still thinking 'Asia/Jayapura' is the base timezone, which is GMT+9 hours. When Moodle stores the timestamp, it subtracts the 9 hours from the current time, storing a "UTC" timestamp value. When Moodle then goes to display a time (i.e. assignment conditional access times), it adds +9.5 hours to the timestamp which gives the incorrect time.    When using "Server's local time", it works fine and there is no issue either. However, if Moodle is set to use "Server's local time", and then a user manually sets their timezone, it is again incorrect.    Might be related to MDL-22625, but it seems a little different again.	20
The link Create "File system" instance do not work	if an admin has defined that user can add repository instances into the user context, user sees the Create File system instance link, but they don't get permission to do this.   Screen shows on left left side admin settings and the parts in the middle and on the right side are the users view.	5
